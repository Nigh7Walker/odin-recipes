For this project I'm going make a recipe site.

These sites are going to display what i have learned for the past couple of days.

For the first site Mac and Cheese I only had on problem i didnt figure out right away.
Found the problem a few days later when i asked my friend for help and gave me hints on what might be the problem. The problem I had was adding my image to the site, I thought I understood the period (./ and ../) system for finding the image in another folder.

The second site was a day after the first site. I used the first site I created as a reference on what the layout should look like. Also had the same problem with adding image and figured it out later.

The third site I did the same thing with the first and second site, used them as a reference.
